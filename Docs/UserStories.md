## Event Processing

* As a user 
- I want to process logs for:
    - a specific event for a specific contract address 
    - a specific event for many instances of the same contract
    - any event raised on a specific contracts address 
    - any event raised on multiple contracts of the same type
- I want to filter events based on:
    - Contract address/s
    - Event Signature/s
    - Event Value
